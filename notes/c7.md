### Chapter 7 - memory allocation

## 7.1 - malloc and friends (heap memory)

* remember: heap grows upwards, stack grows downwards
* brk/sbr -> set heap limit (program break) to higher addresses
* int brk(void *end_data_segment); => returns 0 (ok) or -1 (err)
* void *sbrk(intptr_t increment); => returns previous program break (ok) or -1 (err)
* malloc => allocates memory for heap from list of free blocks and returns pointer to start of location
* free releases block and adds it to list of free blocks
* all memory is release on program termination automatically by the OS
* debugging tools: mtrace, mcheck, valgrind

## 7.2 - heap memory allocation: alloca and friends

* alloca => expands stack pointer and makes more memory avaiable
*  void *alloca(size_t size); => returns pointer to block allocated
