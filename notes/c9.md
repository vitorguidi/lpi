### Chapter 9: Process Credentials

real UID/GID
effective UID/GID
saved set-user-id/set-group-id
supplementary gids

## 9.1: Real user id and real group id

* from login process, shell gets it from /etc/passwd 3rd and 4th fields
* child processes inherit from parent

## 9.2: effective user and group id

* control access to resources (ipc/files/etc)

## 9.3: set-user-id and set-group-id

* execution bit is unset, set or S for user and group
* if it is s, whoever executes the file will set its effective UID/GID to the ones in the file
* if it is S, setuid is set but cannot execute. useless
* the suid mechanism does not work for sh files (why? chapter 38)

Example with cpp program suid.cpp:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	    std::ifstream f("lol");

    if (f.is_open())
        std::cout << f.rdbuf();


vitor@Pato:~/Desktop/lool$ ls -l
total 28
-rwx------ 1 root  root      2 jan 18 00:44 lol
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root  root  20472 jan 18 01:05 suid
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vitor vitor   145 jan 18 01:05 suid.cpp

vitor@Pato:~/Desktop/lool$ sudo -s
root@Pato:/home/vitor/Desktop/lool# cat lol
3
root@Pato:/home/vitor/Desktop/lool# exit
vitor@Pato:~/Desktop/lool$ cat lol
cat: lol: Permission denied

vitor@Pato:~/Desktop/lool$ ./suid 
3

## 9.4: saved set-user-id and saved set-group-id

* works as memory for set-user-id and set-group-id programs to regain the privilege
* When a program is executed, if s bit is enabled, EUID is made same as owner of file. If s is not set, EUID stays the same
* Regardless of s being set, EUID is copied into saved EUID (same applies for group)

## 9.5: File-System User ID and File-System Group ID

* Linux has these non standar filesystem group and user IDs, responsible for file operation permissions
* Reason is for security with NFS way back in time
* Makes zero practical difference

## 9.6: Supplementary group ids

* The supplementary group IDs are a set of additional groups to which a process
belongs
