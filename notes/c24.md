### 24: Process creation

## 1: fork, exit, execve, wait

* fork => creates child process with copy of stack, data, heap and text segment
* exit => terminates process and frees resources to the OS
* wait(&status) => waits for a child process to complete with exit and sets the exit status of child to the &status mem location
* exec(path, argv, env) => loads a new program into stack/data/tex/heap, discarding previous ones

## 2: fork

* when forked, file descriptors are the same (same ids point to the same entries in the system wide table of open FDs)

## 3: vfork

* too niche, screw this

## 4: race conditions

* never assume order, always synchronize

## 5: signal sync

* Can synchronize with signals. Threads mutex etc are better, this is too low lvl
