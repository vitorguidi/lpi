### Chapter 13: File Buffering

## 13.1: Kernel buffer

* When working with disk files, the read() and write() system calls donâ€™t directly initiate disk access

## 13.2: stdio

* int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
* mode: _IONBF (do not buffer), _IOLBF (line buffered), _IOFBF(fully buffered)
* fflush => regardless of buffering policy, flushes data in the buffer when called

## 13.3 - kernel buffering

* Synchronized io completion: operation that successfully persisted to disk or was diagnosed unsuccessfull
* Synchronized IO data integrity completion: all data has been transfered to allow future retrieval of complete data.
 - For write this means that all data has been xfered to disk and enough metadata to allow future retrieval (pointers, inode, whatever)
 - For read this means that all data is available to the process from the source. If there were pending writes before the read, all writes complete first
* Sincronized IO file integrity completion: all file metadata and data is successfully transfered to disk
* int fsync(int fd); -> flushes kernel buffer to disk. returns 0 success, -1 fialure. Forces synchronized I/O file integrity completion state
* int fdatasync(int fd); ->  operates similarly to fsync(), but only forces the file
to the synchronized I/O data integrity completion state. (incomplete metadata is possible)
* void sync(void); -> fsync to all kernel buffers
* Specifying the O_SYNC flag when calling open() makes all subsequent output
synchronous: fd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_SYNC); Causes writes to be performed according to the requirements of synchronized I/O file integrity completion (like fsync())
* Specifying O_DSYNC in OPEN will astisfty requirements of  synchronized I/O data integrity completion
* The O_RSYNC flag is specified in conjunction with either O_SYNC or O_DSYNC, and
extends the write behaviors of these flags to read operations
* O_DIRECT is direct io, bypasses kernel cache
