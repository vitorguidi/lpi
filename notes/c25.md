### 25: Process termination

## 1: _exit and exit

* exit is a wrapper for _exit
* exit handlers are invoked in reverse order of registration
* exit => exit handlers are called (registered with alexit and on_exit), stdio stream buffers are flushed and _exit syscall is invoked


##  2: process termination

* check in the future, too much info

## 3: exit handlers

* This is C stuff, dont bother

## 4: _exit stdio fork interaction

* too specific, come back later once you need it
