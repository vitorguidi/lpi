### Pipes

## 1: Overview

* ls . | wc -l
* writes are atomic up to PIPE_BUF bytes

## 2: Creation

* int pipe(int filedes[2]);Returns 0 on success, or â€“1 on error. writes the id of input fd on index0, id of output fd in id 1
* After fork, reader closes its write fd and writer closes its read fd

## 5: popen

* FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *mode); => creates a pipe an execs two child processes, making children communicate
* int pclose(FILE *stream);

## 7: fifo

* Similar to pipe, but has a name in the filesystem
* Can be used to communicate between unrelated processes
* Can use tee to listen to data in two endpoints from the same input

$ mkfifo myfifo
$ wc -l < myfifo &
$ ls -l | tee myfifo | sort -k5n
